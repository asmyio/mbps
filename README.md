# Motorcyclist’s Behavioural Performance System

* Development of a System for Motorcyclist’s Behavioural Performance towards Real-time Turn Signal Usage for Collision Avoidance Systems

Motorcycle turn signal module is used for notifying other drivers or road users before the motorcyclist make a turn or changing lane. However, sometimes the motorcyclist forgets to turn-on or turn-off the turn signal. This may give a wrong information to other road users and can be dangerous to the motorcyclists and other road users. Therefore, the behavioural assessment is needed to obtain the performance of turn signal usage among motorcyclists at the junctions or roundabout in order to improve the motorcyclist’s safety.

### Features

* Detects Rider's turn signal usage at road junction
* Data Analytics Dashboard for Rider's Performance
